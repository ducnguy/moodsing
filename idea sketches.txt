1. modulate sine frequency with brainwave
	1. find js sound generator
	2. then, map emotive output --> generator
		1. how does that work? similar to requestAnimationFrame()?
2. process raw emotiv data better.
	1. average over time interval?
	2. peak over time interval?
	3. don't want music to abruptly change because of lapse in concentration to feed emotiv.

## Sound details
- sampled from Rusoto - like sound

## Parameters to use from Emotiv channels
- Excitement vs Calm - used for drum beat because this feedback loop could be reliable
- Stress - everything else

## Ideas for modulating music
- cutoff frequency modulated for background pad
- intensity of some parameter brings in loops in the next bar
